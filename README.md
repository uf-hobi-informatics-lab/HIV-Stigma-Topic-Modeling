# Topic Modeling of HIV Stigma Dimensions, Social, and Related Behavioral Circumstances

This project applies natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling to electronic health record (EHR) clinical notes to uncover how HIV stigma and related social and behavioral circumstances are expressed among people living with HIV (PLWHs). Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), expert-curated keyword lists, and demographic subgroup analysis, the study characterizes the topics of stigma, offering new insights into the patterns within clinical documentation.
